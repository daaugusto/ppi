# Functionality #

 - Implements the cost matrix for classification

   The cost matrix can be passed at build time; for instance:
      cmake ... -DCOSTMATRIX="{{0,1,1},{1,0,1},{1,1,0}}"

   This would require to have two error vectors: one for the raw
("presentable") error (without the cost matrix) and for the modified error
(that will guide the search) using the cost matrix.


# Optimization #

 - Implements the genome vector as a truly binary vector. In other words, it
   would be represented as a vector of 32/64-bit numbers and bit masks would be
used to access individual bits.
