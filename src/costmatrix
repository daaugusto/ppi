/* The variable COST will be replaced with the definition from
   '-DCOST=<matrix>' at building time. For instance, if given:
  
      cmake ... -DCOST='[4]={{0,1,1,1},{1,0,1,1},{1,1,0,1},{1,1,1,0}}'

   Then, the line @COST@ below will be replaced by:

      const float COST[][4]={{0,1,1,1},{1,0,1,1},{1,1,0,1},{1,1,1,0}};
*/

@COST@
